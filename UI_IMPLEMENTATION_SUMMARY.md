- **Job Detail View**: Detailed job information and real-time action log
- **Conflict Resolution View**: Interactive conflict resolution interface
- **Settings View**: System status and configuration display
- **Help View**: Complete keyboard shortcuts and usage guide

### Real-time Capabilities
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live connection to PocketBase backend
- **Auto-reconnection**: Robust connection handling with exponential backoff
- **Real-time Updates**: Live job progress, status changes, and action logs
- **Offline Mode**: Graceful degradation when connection is unavailable

### User Interface Features
- **Color-coded Status**: Intuitive visual job status indicators
- **Progress Bars**: ASCII progress visualization for active jobs
- **Responsive Navigation**: Keyboard-driven navigation with vim-style keys
- **Context-sensitive Help**: Dynamic footer with relevant key bindings
- **Data Visualization**: Humanized file sizes and completion percentages

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **ratatui (0.24)**: Terminal UI framework for rendering
- **crossterm (0.27)**: Cross-platform terminal manipulation
- **tokio-tungstenite (0.20)**: Async WebSocket client
- **serde & serde_json**: JSON serialization for WebSocket messages
- **chrono**: Date/time handling and formatting
- **uuid**: Unique identifier generation
- **tracing**: Logging and diagnostics

### Key Components

#### Data Models (`types.rs`)
- `Job`: Comprehensive job representation with metadata
- `JobStatus`: Status enumeration (Pending, Running, Paused, etc.)
- `JobPriority`: Priority levels (Low, Normal, High, Critical)
- `Conflict`: File conflict representation with resolution options
- `ActionLogEntry`: Action log with severity levels
- `AppState`: Central application state management

#### WebSocket Client (`websocket.rs`)
- Bidirectional communication with PocketBase
- Message-based protocol for job control
- Automatic subscription to job updates and action logs
- Robust error handling and reconnection logic

#### UI Rendering (`ui.rs`)
- Modular view system with clean separation
- Responsive layout with dynamic sizing
- Color-coded status indicators
- Progress visualization and data formatting

#### Event Handling (`events.rs`)
- Comprehensive keyboard input processing
- Context-aware key bindings
- Job control commands (start, pause, stop, retry)
- Navigation and view switching

## üìä Dashboard Features

### Job Management
- **View Jobs**: List all synchronization jobs with status
- **Job Details**: Complete job information and progress tracking
- **Job Control**: Start, pause, stop, and retry jobs
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress bars and statistics

### Conflict Resolution
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic identification of file conflicts
- **Resolution Options**: Keep Source, Keep Target, Merge, Skip
- **Interactive Resolution**: User-friendly conflict resolution interface
- **Progress Tracking**: Track resolved vs pending conflicts

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Live Updates**: WebSocket-based real-time job updates
- **Action Logs**: Live streaming of job actions and events
- **Status Changes**: Immediate notification of job state changes
- **Error Reporting**: Real-time error messages and diagnostics

## üéÆ User Interface

### Navigation
- **Arrow Keys/vim Keys**: Move through lists and menus
- **Enter**: Select items or enter detail views
- **Esc**: Go back to previous view
- **Number Keys**: Quick view switching and conflict resolution

### Job Control
- **s**: Start selected job
- **p**: Pause running job
- **t**: Stop active job
- **r**: Retry failed job
- **c**: View conflicts for selected job

### View Management
- **h/?**: Show help screen
- **1**: Switch to Home view
- **2**: Switch to Settings view
- **q**: Quit application (from Home view)
- **Ctrl+C**: Force quit from any view

## üìà Demo Data

Includes comprehensive demo data for testing:
- 4 sample jobs with different statuses and priorities
- Simulated progress data with file counts and byte transfers
- Sample conflicts for testing resolution interface
- Action log entries with different severity levels

## üîå Integration Points

### PocketBase WebSocket Protocol
- **Subscriptions**: Jobs and action logs collections
- **Commands**: Job control (start, pause, stop, retry)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Send resolution decisions to backend
- **Real-time Updates**: Receive live job state changes

### Message Types
- `job_update`: Job status and progress updates
- `job_created`: New job notifications
- `job_deleted`: Job removal notifications
- `action_log`: Live action log entries
- `ping/pong`: Connection health monitoring

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
# Run the TUI dashboard
cargo run --bin ui

# With debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin ui
```

### Building
```bash
# Build the UI crate
cargo build -p ui

# Build optimized release
cargo build -p ui --release

# Run tests
cargo test -p ui
```

## üîÑ Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, events, and data
- **Modular Design**: Independent, testable components
- **State Management**: Centralized application state with immutable updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

### Performance
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal redraws with targeted updates
- **Responsive UI**: 250ms refresh rate for smooth interaction
- **Memory Management**: Bounded log storage (1000 entries per job)
- **Network Efficiency**: WebSocket for low-latency real-time updates

### Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new views and features
- **Configurable**: Settings view for runtime configuration
- **Themeable**: Color scheme and styling easily customizable
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large numbers of jobs and logs
