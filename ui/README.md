- Dashboard runs in offline mode
- Last known state is displayed
- Automatic reconnection attempts in progress

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Dashboard
```bash
# Run the TUI dashboard
cargo run --bin ui

# Or with specific log level
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin ui
```

### Basic Workflow
1. Launch the dashboard
2. Browse jobs in the Home view
3. Select a job and press `Enter` for details
4. Use `s`/`p`/`t` keys to control job execution
5. Press `c` to resolve any conflicts
6. Use `h` for help at any time

### Conflict Resolution
1. Navigate to a job with conflicts
2. Press `c` to enter conflict resolution view
3. Use `‚Üë`/`‚Üì` to select conflicts
4. Press `1`-`4` to choose resolution:
   - `1`: Keep source file
   - `2`: Keep target file
   - `3`: Attempt merge
   - `4`: Skip this file
5. Press `Esc` to return to job details

## Configuration

The dashboard uses the default PocketBase configuration:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8090`
- **WebSocket**: `ws://localhost:8090/ws`
- **Auto-reconnect**: Enabled with exponential backoff

```

## Architecture

```

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs          # Application entry point and loop
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.rs         # Data structures and state management

```

The dashboard follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns:
- **Types**: Pure data structures and business logic
- **UI**: Rendering and visual presentation
- **Events**: Input handling and user interaction
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication and state updates
- **Main**: Application lifecycle and coordination
